## Deployment Steps

### üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Initial Deployment

There are two ways to deploy **LogicApp** to Nutanix:
- **Prism Element**
- **Prism Central**

There are also two ways to upload the LogicApp qcow to **Prism Element** or **Prism Central**

- Upload Image through the image service on **Prism Element** or **Prism Central**
- Upload through a local file that was downloaded to a local computer.

LogicApp can be downloaded from AWS directly [download link](https://logicappupdate.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/LogicAPP/latest.qcow2).

### üöÄ Initial Configuration

1. **Create a VM** on either **Prism Central** or **Prism Element**.
2. **Name the VM** ‚Äî we recommend **LogicInsight Appliance**, but you can follow your own naming standards.
3. **Add a description** ‚Äî suggested: **LogicInsight Nutanix Monitoring Appliance**.
4. **Set the timezone** to either **UTC** or local cluster time ‚Äî we suggest keeping it at **UTC**.
5. **Minimum CPU:** 4 vCPUs.
6. **Minimum cores per vCPU:** 1.
7. **Minimum RAM:** 4 GB.
8. **Boot Configuration:** Set to **Legacy BIOS**.
9. **Remove the CD-ROM** from the VM.
10. **Add a New Disk**:
    - Clone from **Image Service** and select the appliance image that was previously downloaded or uploaded.
11. **Add a Network Adapter**:
    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è LogicInsight can run on any subnet, as long as it can communicate with **Prism Central** and **Prism Element** on port **9440**.  
    > *(Optional: For IPMI integration, ensure connectivity on port **443** to the IPMI hosts.)*
12. **Save and power on** the VM.

### üëæ Post Configuration


## Dashboards Overview  
The **Logic Insight Public Datadog Dashboards** are designed to provide comprehensive monitoring and visualization for Logic Insight LogicApp. These dashboards deliver near-time insights into performance, usage, and error metrics, enabling users to efficiently manage and troubleshoot their Nutanix workflows. 

## Key Features
- **Optimization Insights** Forecasting, resiliency planning, and advanced analytics.
- **Error Monitoring**: Tracks and highlights issues, errors, and failure trends.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Visualizes performance, run latency, and throughput for Nutanix operations.  
- **Usage Insights**: Displays metrics like total resillency, data protection, user actions, and much more!  
- **Alert Integration**: Easily set up alerts for critical metrics directly within Datadog.  

## Prerequisites  
Before using these dashboards, ensure the following are in place:  
1. **Logic Insight LogicApp Deployed**: A functional Logic App Appliance in your environment.  
2. **Datadog Account**: An active Datadog account with proper permissions to create and view dashboards.
