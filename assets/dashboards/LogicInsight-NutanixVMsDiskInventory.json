{"title":"LogicInsight - Nutanix VMs Disk Inventory","description":"### üìä LogicInsight - Nutanix VMs Disk Inventory Dashboard Explanation\n\nThis **LogicInsight - Nutanix VMs Disk Inventory** dashboard provides a **detailed inventory of all virtual machine (VM) disks** within the Nutanix environment. It helps administrators **track disk allocations, sizes, and storage container assignments**, ensuring **storage management and capacity planning** are effective.\n\n***\n\n## **1Ô∏è‚É£ VM Disk Summary Table (Main Section)**\n\nThis **single-table view** consolidates information for **every disk assigned to VMs** in the selected clusters. It is organized by the following fields:\n\n| Field                    | Description                                                                                                                                          |\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **CLUSTER_NAME**         | The Nutanix cluster where the VM and its disk reside.                                                                    |\n| **VM_NAME**              | The name of the virtual machine the disk is assigned to. If it says \"none\", the disk is **unassigned or not attached** to a VM.                      |\n| **DISK_ADDRESS**         | Logical identifier of the disk within the system (like a SCSI address or virtual disk number).                                                       |\n| **STORAGE_CONTAINER_ID** | Unique ID of the **storage container** where the disk is located. This indicates the **logical storage space** allocated to the disk within Nutanix. |\n| **DISK_SIZE**            | The **total capacity** of the disk. Examples:                                                                                                        |\n\n-   `200 TiB` (very large disks, likely storage pools)\n-   `59.629 TiB` (smaller but still significant capacity)\\\n    A **progress bar** visually represents disk size for quick analysis.\n\n***\n\n## **2Ô∏è‚É£ What You Can Do with This Dashboard**\n\n-   ‚úÖ **Identify orphan disks**\\\n    Disks with **no VM association (VM_NAME = none)** may indicate **unused resources** or disks awaiting cleanup.\n-   ‚úÖ **Track disk allocation by storage container**\\\n    Helps **ensure even distribution** of data across different storage containers for **performance optimization** and **capacity planning**.\n-   ‚úÖ **Monitor disk sizes**\\\n    Ensure disks **match VM workload requirements**. Very large disks may need closer attention for **backup or replication strategy**.\n\n***\n\n## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Typical Use Cases**\n\n-   üõ†Ô∏è **Audit and Inventory:**\\\n    Regularly check for disks that are **no longer in use** or improperly sized.\n-   üßπ **Reclaim Unused Storage:**\\\n    Free up capacity by identifying and removing **orphan disks**.\n-   üîÑ **Capacity Planning and Forecasting:**\\\n    Understand where your **storage is consumed** to predict when additional capacity will be required.\n\n***\n\n## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Notes and Best Practices**\n\n-   **VM_NAME ‚Äúnone‚Äù**:\\\n    Review these disks periodically. They might be:\n\n    -   Detached disks\n    -   Unused clones\n    -   Part of a template\n\n-   **Disk Size vs. Storage Container**:\\\n    Validate whether storage containers are **balanced** or if some are **over-provisioned**.\n\n***\n\n### ‚úÖ Why This Dashboard Matters\n\nThis **VM Disk Inventory Dashboard** enables:\n\n-   **Full visibility** of VM disk allocation and storage usage.\n-   **Better storage governance**, ensuring resources are properly allocated and monitored.\n-   **Cost optimization**, by identifying and addressing **wasted storage**.","widgets":[{"id":8087122381218750,"definition":{"type":"image","url":"https://logicappupdate.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dash_logo.png","sizing":"cover","has_background":true,"has_border":false,"vertical_align":"center","horizontal_align":"center"},"layout":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":12,"height":1}},{"id":7678086330086404,"definition":{"title":"VM Disk Summary","title_size":"16","title_align":"left","type":"query_table","requests":[{"queries":[{"data_source":"metrics","name":"query1","query":"avg:logicinsight.pe.vdisk_disk_capacity_in_bytes{$vm_name} by {ntnx_cluster_name,vm_name,disk_address,storage_container_id}","aggregator":"avg"}],"response_format":"scalar","sort":{"count":500,"order_by":[{"type":"formula","index":0,"order":"desc"}]},"formulas":[{"cell_display_mode":"bar","number_format":{"unit":{"type":"canonical_unit","unit_name":"byte"}},"alias":"DISK_SIZE","formula":"query1"}]}],"has_search_bar":"auto"},"layout":{"x":0,"y":1,"width":12,"height":10}}],"template_variables":[{"name":"vm_name","prefix":"vm_name","available_values":[],"default":"*"}],"layout_type":"ordered","notify_list":[],"reflow_type":"fixed"}
